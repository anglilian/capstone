Each author draws from a similar pool of evidence — the things they’ve heard and seen, and that which was recorded. Yet, each author comes away with a different interpretation of events. None of the authors present a singular Truth behind May 13, but attempt to explain the tragedy’s significance in Malaysia.<br></p>
                <p class="text-content">This article provides an academic view of May 13. It attempts to show you, dear reader, who may not have an interest in reading these works yourself or find them inaccessible, what <strong>historians </strong>have to say about May 13. After reading this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">15-minute article</span>, I hope that you will learn the different interpretations of May 13 and how they came to be, so you might form your own conclusions on what the tragedy means for Malaysians and how we might move forward from it.<br></p>

In his account, the UMNO procession started a little before 6:30 pm from Dato Harun’s house and immediately devolved into anti-Chinese violence. Slimming did not explain why the procession left an hour earlier than the planned time or any reasons more than ‘savagery’ for their attacks.<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="14" data-footnote-content="Slimming, Malaysia: Death of a Democracy, 29–31.">14</button> While Slimming saw the Chinese and Indian communities as protecting themselves against the Malays, the NOC report argued the opposite.<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="14" data-footnote-content="Slimming, Malaysia: Death of a Democracy, 29–31.">14</button><br><br>Despite their differences, the NOC and Slimming agreed that the gathering of Malays at Dato Harun’s house provided significant kindling for the flames of mass violence to erupt.

It begs the question that Slimming posed in his book:&nbsp;<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="14" data-footnote-content="Slimming, Malaysia: Death of a Democracy, 28.">14</button>&nbsp;<br></p>
                                <p style="font-family: 'Special Elite';">Why was the Government taken by surprise when so many people, police and civilians alike, were fully aware of what was going to happen, several hours before the slaughter began?<br></p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </section>
                    <p class="text-content">There were several opportunities where Harun could have decided to and was actively prompted to discourage the UMNO procession. The first instance was when the idea for the procession was pitched. Dato Harun had ‘tried to discourage [a group of UMNO supporters] from holding a victory procession’ for fear that ‘something untoward might happen’.<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="14" data-footnote-content="Abdul Razak bin Dato’ Hussein, The May 13 Tragedy: A Report, 38–41.">14</button> Contrary to the police concerns that the UMNO procession would be attacked, this statement was fearful of the Malays themselves creating disorder for it was only through assurance that they would hold the procession in a ‘peaceful and orderly manner’ that he approved it.<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="14" data-footnote-content="Abdul Razak bin Dato’ Hussein, The May 13 Tragedy: A Report, 38–41.">14</button> Harun was popular in Kampong Baru and among the UMNO Youth, but he was overconfident to think he could control a group numbering in the hundreds with just his voice.<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="14" data-footnote-content="Goh, The May 13th Incident and Democracy in Malaysia, 23–24.">14</button> Even as the crowds grew outside his house with palpable intensity and obvious weaponry, Harun rejected his second chance to call off the procession or at the very least disarm and increase police presence around 3 pm when two senior police officers warned him about the possibility of violence. These rumours of violence were seconded by the Selangor Police Headquarters, which the NOC reports as hearing rumours that it would be a ‘peaceful procession but, one that could respond in kind if attacked’.<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="14" data-footnote-content="Abdul Razak bin Dato’ Hussein, The May 13 Tragedy: A Report, 58.">14</button><br></p>
                    <p class="text-content"><strong>In Slimming’s view, the riots directly resulted from UMNO’s encouragement and its willful ignorance of the impending violence.</strong><br></p>
                    <p class="text-content">Slimming additionally exonerated the Communists, which the NOC report highlighted as one of the main causes of the riots through an examination of the Labour Party funeral procession on 9 May 1969. Despite the sensitivity to communist threats after their insurgency during the Emergency (1948-1960), the government still permitted the funeral procession on the eve of polling day. The police did not attempt to stop the procession when Maoist chanting and diversions from the approved route began.<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="14" data-footnote-content="Slimming, Malaysia: Death of a Democracy, 16-17.">14</button> The police’s lassitude in dealing with the demonstrations and the government’s contradictory stance on Communism suggests more underfoot than Slimming digs into in his book. The Communists held a peaceful demonstration even with every opportunity to disrupt the general elections, which they had boycotted to push for class over communal solidarity, proving, according to Slimming, that the Communists were not involved.<br></p>

                    <p class="text-content">Professor of History and International Relations at University Malaya Goh Cheng Teik’s <em>The May Thirteenth Incident and Democracy in Malaysia </em>also draws on interviews with several politicians and reporters.<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="14" data-footnote-content="<a href=&quot; http://harvardclubofmalaysia.org/profile-datuk-dr-goh-cheng-teik/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Harvard Club of Malaysia, ‘Profile – Datuk Dr. Goh Cheng Teik’</a>, accessed 19 November 2021.">14</button> Written two years after the event, Goh’s work builds off of Slimming’s with a comparison of the political climate in Selangor compared to two other states, namely Perak and Penang, where the Alliance Party’s position was threatened in sparking violence, a detailed appendix of all significant political entities and actors during May 13 and an examination of the impact and role of East Malaysia.&nbsp;<br><br>In comparison with Slimming, Goh’s work is more focused on understanding what May 13 means for democracy in Malaysia rather than on assigning blame. He focuses on the structural features of Malaysian society which caused May 13. The book even concludes with a contradictory solution for minority groups to appease the existing Malay-leaning structures to achieve democracy — a system that is supposed to fairly represent the people’s interests.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Goh’s book interpreted the events as a series of rational decisions made by anxious people.</strong> In his view, the Alliance’s increasing loss of power to the opposition and Dato Harun’s UMNO procession were rational responses to a crisis of democracy, catalysed by racial slurs and threats from one ethnic community against another. However, his arguments of rationality fall short when we assess the government’s reactions to the oft-cited causes of May 13 — the opposition’s victory processions.<br></p>
                    <p class="text-content">On 4 May 1969, a police officer shot and killed a Chinese youth LPM member allegedly in self-defence when they were caught putting up anti-election posters in Kepong, Kuala Lumpur.<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="14" data-footnote-content="Abdul Razak bin Dato’ Hussein, The May 13 Tragedy: A Report, 27–28.">14</button> His body was frozen while the LPM arranged to hold a funeral procession on the polling day, which the police (most likely in guilt) compromised to allow them to hold it on 9 May (Friday) instead.<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="14" data-footnote-content="Abdul Razak bin Dato’ Hussein, The May 13 Tragedy: A Report, 27–28.">14</button> The procession was meant to be limited to non-main roads and a thousand participants, but the LPM went all out.<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="14" data-footnote-content="Abdul Razak bin Dato’ Hussein, The May 13 Tragedy: A Report, 27–28.">14</button> The almost entirely Chinese procession shouted Maoist chants and racially incisive remarks against the Malays as they marched through the main streets of Kuala Lumpur, stalling traffic and creating a fearsome display.<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="14" data-footnote-content="Abdul Razak bin Dato’ Hussein, The May 13 Tragedy: A Report, 27–28.">14</button> No one was injured or killed at the end of it, but it thickened the Malay-Chinese tensions.

                    <p class="text-content">Following these two books, there was a dry spell with no substantial works written about May 13 until Kua Kia Soong’s <em>May 13: Declassified Documents on the Malaysian Riots of 1969</em>, published in 2007, almost 40 years after the event. It is difficult to determine the impact of the Sedition Act on the production of academic works, but there was certainly a shortage of primary sources with media censorship and the taboo with speaking about May 13.&nbsp;<br><br>In light of this, Kua was poised to deal with both challenges having been arrested for over a year under the Internal Security Act in 1987 for his part in a Chinese education movement, having shown tenacity to continue publishing works critical about Malaysia, and having founded Suara Rakyat Malaysia (<a href="https://www.suaram.net/">SUARAM</a>), a human rights NGO.<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="10" data-footnote-content="Kia Soong Kua, May 13: Declassified Documents on the Malaysia Riots of 1969 (Petaling Jaya: Suaram Komunikasi, 2007), sec.

His work is scathing and unapologetic in its demands for work towards a better Malaysia, which is opposed to the fatalist conclusions of Slimming and Goh. <br><br>Although Kua claimed that the documents released ‘clearly show that there was a plan to unleash the violence’, his book failed to tie his points to the main argument.<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="10" data-footnote-content="Kua, May 13: Declassified Documents on the Malaysia Riots of 1969, 3, 5–6.">11</button> He argued for three main points which bolstered his claim of a coup.<br></p>

                    <p class="text-content">The final work which added substantial arguments on the government’s complicity in May 13 was Karl von Vorys’s book <em>Democracy Without Consensus: Communalism and Political Stability in Malaysia</em>. His work can be read as a reassessment of Goh’s answer to the question of Malaysia’s future as a democratic state. Published in 2015, 44 years after Goh, von Vorys examined the robustness of Malaysia’s political systems since its independence when the country had ample time to work out its growing pains.<br><br>von Vorys gave an extremely detailed account of the events leading up to May 13 in the chapter <em>Armed Confrontation: From Polls to Parangs </em>which allowed readers a glimpse into the room where it happened. Taken at face value, his work would have cast Dato Harun in a better light than Slimming in narrating the chief minister’s good intentions. von Vorys claimed that Dato Harun was a victim of the Malays’ passion and the will of more powerful UMNO officials. The police permit for the procession was originally signed in his name without his knowledge, even if he continued to uphold it by making every effort to ensure the procession proceeded peacefully.<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="10" data-footnote-content="Vorys, Democracy Without Consensus, 322–23.">11</button>&nbsp;<br><br>However, the glaring problem with his characterisation of Dato Harun and all the events during May 13 is the absence of an explicitly defined source base and methodology. Aside from the blurb on the book jacket, which claims that von Vorys was present during the May 13 riots, he does not expand on how he came by the information, especially details of conversations in the meeting rooms of political parties and the internal thought process of party members, or which parts of his narrative were merely recapitulations of the NOC report as opposed to his own sources. His earlier chapters analysing the campaigns and manifestos of the political parties involved in the General Elections hold up better against scrutiny because his views can at least be corroborated with newspaper reports and the original manifestos published by each party. <strong>However, his work on May 13 itself does not hold water and is therefore inadmissible in understanding what happened during May 13.</strong><br></p>

                <p class="text-content">Many others have come forward in the oral history projects hosted by Malaysiakini, May 13 Incident Oral History Group, among others to record the experiences of those who lived through May 13, as an antidote against national forgetting. Their stories form the threads of the rich and complex tapestry we call history. But perhaps a tapestry is the wrong metaphor because it implies immutability. Perhaps each story is a bead in a kaleidoscope. You could turn the kaleidoscope around and around to see a different pattern, but the colours will never change. No amount of twisting can change the facts even if we might interpret them differently.<br><br>I do not bring up the past to stir trouble, but to call forth the same hopeful note that the works of the NOC, Slimming, Goh, Kua and von Vorys concluded with. Even if their visions differed, all of them believed that we could build a more harmonious Malaysia. The question is — will the government uphold the interests of <em>all </em>its citizens, regardless of race, religion, gender or sexuality? And if it doesn’t, how will we keep the government accountable?<br></p>
