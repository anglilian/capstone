Years later, other historians published their works to explain the riots. The NOC and these historians based their accounts on the things they had heard and seen and other accounts that were recorded. Still, each of these works has a different interpretation of May 13. None of them presented a singular Truth behind May 13 but attempted to explain the tragedy’s significance in Malaysia.<br></p>
                <p class="text-content">This article summarises what <strong>historians </strong>have to say about May 13. It is written for those who do not have access to the original works or the time and appropriate prior knowledge to read them. After reading this 15-minute article, you will learn what happened on May 13 and the different interpretations of the event. I hope that reading this will help you reach your own conclusions on what the tragedy means for Malaysians and how we might move forward from it.<br></p>

At about 6pm on 13 May 1969, a group of Malays from the Gombak district who were on their way to Dato Harun’s house for the procession were attacked by some Chinese and Indians.&nbsp;<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="12" data-footnote-content="Abdul Razak bin Dato’ Hussein, The May 13 Tragedy: A Report, 42–49.">12</button><br></p>

                                <p>Slimming claims that Dato Harun would have seen how large the procession was growing.

Dato Harun’s house is situated on a major road in the heart of Kuala Lumpur, no more than two kilometres from the UMNO headquarters.&nbsp;<br></p>

                    </section>
                    <p class="text-content"><br>Furthermore, there were several opportunities where Harun could have decided to and was actively prompted to discourage the UMNO procession. The first was when the idea for the procession was pitched. Dato Harun had ‘tried to discourage [a group of UMNO supporters] from holding a victory procession’ for fear that ‘something untoward might happen’.<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="14" data-footnote-content="Abdul Razak bin Dato’ Hussein, The May 13 Tragedy: A Report, 38–41.">14</button> He only approved the procession under the assurance that it would proceed in a ‘peaceful and orderly manner’.<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="14" data-footnote-content="Abdul Razak bin Dato’ Hussein, The May 13 Tragedy: A Report, 38–41.">14</button> Harun was popular in Kampong Baru and among the UMNO Youth, but he was overconfident to think he could control a group numbering in the hundreds with just his voice. <button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="14" data-footnote-content="Goh, The May 13th Incident and Democracy in Malaysia, 23–24.">14</button><br><br>Even as the crowd grew outside his house with palpable intensity and obvious weaponry, Harun rejected his second chance to call off the procession. At around 3pm on May 13, Slimming cites that two senior police officers warned Harun about the possibility of violence from the procession and asked him to call it off. The Selangor Police Headquarters seconded these rumours of violence. The NOC reported that the HQ had heard rumours that it would be a ‘peaceful procession but one that could respond in kind if attacked’.<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="14" data-footnote-content="Abdul Razak bin Dato’ Hussein, The May 13 Tragedy: A Report, 58.">14</button> This shows that it was common knowledge that the procession participants were armed, yet no one did anything to stop it.<br></p>
                    <p class="text-content"><strong>In Slimming’s view, the riots directly resulted from UMNO’s encouragement and its willful ignorance of the impending violence. </strong>Or to quote Slimming directly:<br></p>
                    <p class="text-content" style="font-family: 'Special Elite';">Why was the Government taken by surprise when so many people, police and civilians alike, were fully aware of what was going to happen, several hours before the slaughter began?<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="14" data-footnote-content="Slimming, Malaysia: Death of a Democracy, 28.">14</button><br></p>
                    <p class="text-content">Slimming also disagreed that the Communists were a significant cause of May 13. The Communists held a peaceful demonstration even with every opportunity to disrupt the general elections, proving, according to him, that the Communists were not involved. His book examined the Labour Party funeral procession on 9 May 1969 as evidence. The government approved the request for the funeral procession on the eve of the polling day, despite the country’s sensitivity to communist threats after their insurgency during the Emergency (1948-1960). The police did not stop the procession when Maoist chanting and diversions from the approved route began.<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="14" data-footnote-content="Slimming, Malaysia: Death of a Democracy, 16-17.">14</button> The lack of response from the police and government suggests more than Slimming explicitly dives into in his book on how little perceived power the Communists had.<br><br><strong>So was Slimming or the NOC right?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>The unsatisfying answer is that we won’t know. The NOC was not transparent about how it conducted its investigation. Moreover, the investigations were not conducted by a neutral party but by the government itself, which has a vested interest in ensuring the narrative of May 13 favours them. On the other hand, Slimming has no apparent motive for pinning the blame on the government as a non-Malaysian who has shown a commitment to the country in his military service. <br><br>However, we are similarly unable to reproduce his interviews with witnesses.&nbsp;Nevertheless, history is not an endeavour for the Truth. Slimming’s book and the NOC’s report reveal different aspects of May 13, which we need to carefully examine as readers to gain a fuller understanding of what the tragedy means for Malaysia.<br><br></p>

The book focused on understanding democracy in Malaysia in light of May 13 and the structural features of Malaysian society that caused the tragedy. It also includes a comparison of the political climate in Selangor with Perak and Penang, where the Alliance Party did not win the majority vote and a detailed appendix of all significant political entities and actors during May 13.<br><br><strong>Goh’s book interpreted the events as a series of rational decisions made by anxious people. </strong>He argued that the riots were a rational response to the racial slurs and threats between each ethnic community and the Alliance’s increasing loss of power.&nbsp;<br></p>
                    <p class="text-content"><br>The racial slurs and threats from the Chinese to the Malays came from the processions of three political parties leading up to May 13. The first was the Labour Party of Malaysia (LPM) organised a funeral procession on 9 May 1969, the eve of the elections, with police approval.<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="14" data-footnote-content="Abdul Razak bin Dato’ Hussein, The May 13 Tragedy: A Report, 27–28.">14</button> The funeral was for a Chinese youth LPM member who was allegedly shot dead in self-defence by a police officer after being caught putting up anti-election posters in Kepong, Kuala Lumpur.<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="14" data-footnote-content="Abdul Razak bin Dato’ Hussein, The May 13 Tragedy: A Report, 27–28.">14</button> The procession was meant to be limited to non-main roads and a thousand participants, but the LPM went all out.<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="14" data-footnote-content="Abdul Razak bin Dato’ Hussein, The May 13 Tragedy: A Report, 27–28.">14</button> The almost entirely Chinese procession shouted Maoist chants and racially incisive remarks against the Malays as they marched through the main streets of Kuala Lumpur, stalling traffic and creating a fearsome display.<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="14" data-footnote-content="Abdul Razak bin Dato’ Hussein, The May 13 Tragedy: A Report, 27–28.">14</button> No one was injured or killed at the end, but it thickened the Malay-Chinese tensions.&nbsp;<br><br>The day after the election results were released (11 May), DAP held a procession to celebrate their unexpected electoral gains with some unlicensed offshoots. The police interviewed by the NOC reported seeing separate processions by the DAP going around the city, jeering at the police with obscenities.<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="14" data-footnote-content="Abdul Razak bin Dato’ Hussein, The May 13 Tragedy: A Report, 29–35.">14</button> The insults were directed at civilian Malays and the police, with one of the processions consisting of about 500 scooters on 12 May.<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="14" data-footnote-content="Abdul Razak bin Dato’ Hussein, The May 13 Tragedy: A Report, 29–35.">14</button> According to police accounts, these insults continued for two whole days, all day long. The police also granted Gerakan a permit to hold their procession on the morning of 12 May.<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="14" data-footnote-content="Abdul Razak bin Dato’ Hussein, The May 13 Tragedy: A Report, 29–35.">14</button> Gerakan and DAP supporters were also reportedly jeering at Malays and Malay houses.<br><br>Goh’s argument on agent rationality comes under fire here. If the government were acting rationally, why did it not take rational steps to preserve public order? The police and Malays were insulted for multiple days, yet the police continued to issue permits for processions and did not take precautionary measures against the slew of racial insults. The government seemed content to allow the people to run amok, perhaps, as Kua Kia Soong suggested, to show them that they had inadvertently chosen a chaos-ridden future by not supporting the Alliance.<button class="btn btn-primary footnote-button citation" type="button" data-footnote-identifier="14" data-footnote-content="Kua, May 13: Declassified Documents on the Malaysia Riots of 1969, 34.">14</button><br><br>However, his account is perhaps influenced by founded fears of persecution under the Sedition Act.

However, his solution contradicts the democracy’s purpose to represent its people’s interests fairly. If the goal is to prevent future violence, putting aside the minority (who make up almost 40% of Malaysia’s population) only exacerbates the problem. As Goh argues, the people were moved by anxiety over perceived threats to their status in Malaysia which is better solved by better representing the interests of <strong>all </strong>Malaysians.<br></p>

                    <p class="text-content">There is little biographical information about Karl von Vorys related to May 13.&nbsp; He was a professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania and author of several other works on the USA and Pakistan. According to the book’s description, von Vorys had observed the riots first hand, but the contents of the book don’t provide any more explanation as to why he was in Malaysia during the time, his relationship with different entities in Malaysia or even where exactly he was during the riots. This is important because his book provides a highly detailed account of the events leading up to May 13 with virtually no reference to how he acquired the information. He cites events, speeches and even the internal thought process of several party members with such accuracy and drama that it is difficult to discern fact from fiction.<br>&nbsp;<br> His earlier chapters do a much better job of citing newspaper reports and the original manifestos of each party to provide a robust analysis of the political parties involved in the General Elections. <strong>However, his work on May 13 itself does not hold water and is therefore inadmissible in understanding what happened during May 13.</strong><br><br></p>

                <p class="text-content">History is a bit like detective work. Sometimes there is evidence available for you to sift through in the form of archival documents, newspaper reports or recorded statements. Sometimes the evidence is thin, and historians need to hunt for them, collecting oral histories and searching for other places that might have more information. For example, the release of documents from the London Public Records Office allowed Kua Kia Soong to write his book, and oral histories collected by <em>MalaysiaKini </em>and the May 13 Incident Oral History Group may become someone else’s evidence base.<br><br>Without new evidence or a substantial archival base to work with, other academics have analysed May 13 through explicitly addressing the government’s attempts to silence the event. Por Heong Hong’s 2017 article <em>Family Narratives and Abandoned Monuments of the May 13 Riot in the Sungai Buloh Leprosarium </em>explored the government’s attempt to create a national forgetting by juxtaposing the burial grounds for May 13 victims with those for war victims.&nbsp;<br></p>

Their stories form the threads of the rich and complex tapestry we call history. But perhaps a tapestry is the wrong metaphor because it implies immutability. Perhaps each story is a bead in a kaleidoscope. You could turn the kaleidoscope around and around to see a different pattern, but the colours will never change. No amount of twisting can change the facts even if we might interpret them differently.<br><br>I do not bring up the past to stir trouble, but to call forth the same hopeful note that the works of the NOC, Slimming, Goh, Kua and von Vorys concluded with. Even if their visions differed, all of them believed that we could build a more harmonious Malaysia. <br><br>I would invite you to reflect on some questions in light of this, perhaps new, perspective:<br></p>

Was there an intentional distortion of facts, rumour-mongering, a shaky memory?<br><br>Will the present-day government uphold the interests of&nbsp;<em>all&nbsp;</em>its citizens, regardless of race, religion, gender or sexuality? <br><br>And if it doesn’t, how will we keep the government accountable?<br><br>Do you think Malaysia today will encounter another May 13?
